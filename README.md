#### The problem is the  education system is not on par
#### The purpose of the app is to promote self studying, easy accessibility, offline, and free.
#### The solution of the app is to enhance technological skills to school kids that are from under privileged communities:

* login with a unique identity 
* choose level page 
* choose the topic you want to learn
* info with chosen topic is distributed
* youtube slides that shows practicals of the topic chosen
* codewars katas that test the student's understanding on that topic
* a page that will enable one to check their progress and 
* bookmark page that keeps record of topics saved
